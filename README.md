# Image classification and object detection with CNNs in Keras
This project focuses on classifying images into three categories and identifying the bounding boxes of objects. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. The model is trained and evaluated using the Keras library in Python.
